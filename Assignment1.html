							<p><b>In this assignment, me and my team conducted a comparative evaluation of various hospital websites using Google Lighthouse. This task allowed me to analyze key performance metrics such as loading speed, accessibility, and SEO. In the end of the report, I gained valuable insights into the importance of web performance optimization and the impact for the user experience.</b></p>

Additionally, by evaluating in more depth of websites, would provide a comprehensive understanding of common performance issues and best practices.</b></p>
