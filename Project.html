							<h1>Development of Hebak - An Educational Website for High School Students</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/Pjt.avif" alt="" style = "width: 100%; height: 300px;"/></span>
							<p><b>In this project, I developed Hebak, an educational website offering lessons for high school students. Through this development, I aimed to provide a valuable resource for students to enhance their learning experience outside the classroom. This project allowed me to apply my technical skills in web development to create a platform with educational content that aligns with the Ministry of Education (Malaysia).</b></p>
							<p><b>To improve Hebak, I could implement features such as interactive quizzes, discussion forums, or personalized learning paths to engage students more effectively. Additionally, incorporating multimedia elements like videos and interactive simulations could enhance the learning experience and cater to different learning styles.</b></p>
							<p><b>This project reinforced my belief in the transformative power of technology in education. It inspired me to continue exploring ways to leverage digital tools to make learning more accessible and engaging for students. Moreover, it highlighted the importance of user-centered design and accessibility considerations in developing educational platforms that cater to diverse learners.</b></p>
